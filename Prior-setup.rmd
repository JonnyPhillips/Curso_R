To setup your computer to participate in the class, it is vital that you complete the following steps *before the class* so that we can start on time:

1. Install the appropriate version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)

2. Install the appropriate version of [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

3. Install [Latex]([https://miktex.org/download)

4. Install key packages by typing and running these commands in Rstudio:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("stargazer")
install.packages("nycflights13")
install.packages("forcats")
```

If you have any problems, please email jonnyphillips [at] gmail.com before the first class so we can fix it.
